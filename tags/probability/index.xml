      <description>I remember the times when I searched for measure theory lectures online and got frustrated immediately at the sight of the abstract definition of Borel set, and the times that I could not wrap my head around when I studied the outer measure in the probability class.</description>

      <description>In the statistics textbooks or papers, one would encounter many theorems and problems that are studying the limiting behavior of a series of random variables, for example, suppose \(X, X_1,&amp;hellip;,X_n,&amp;hellip;\) are random variables defined on a probability space, a question often asked is, what is the probability of the event that \(\lim_{n}X_n = X\)?</description>
