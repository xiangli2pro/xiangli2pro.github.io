<h3 id="1-abstract">1. Abstract</h3>
<p>The social media has become an indispensable part in human’s life, which
has served as a major platform for knowledge &amp; news sharing and makes it
possible for people around the world get connected. Among all the social
media platforms, Twitter has been a critical tool for politicians to
advocate their policies. Therefore, a natural question to ask is how
politicians can make Twitter users to engage with their tweets so that
they can amply their influence and facilitate the proceedings of their
policies and campaigns. In this report, given the tweets posted by the
US senators and representatives in the month January 2021, I will
investigate how the emotions expressed in the tweets, such as anger,
joy, sadness etc., are affecting people’s engagements with the
politicians’ tweets, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The final
data set used for the analysis has 19 variables and 39396
observations/tweets. The outcome variable is binary and it identifies
whether or not a tweet has active engagement with people. The
independent predictors are composed of two parts: user-specific
predictors and tweet-specific predictors. A set of logistic models are
fitted to investigate the contributions of different emotions to the
probability of people engaging with the tweet. The result shows that,
among all the analyzed emotions (anger, joy, sadness, anticipation,
trust, surprise and disgust), “anger” contributes more to the tweets
engagement then other emotions, “joy” makes the second largest
contribution. In addition, the contribution from “anger” and “joy” to
the tweets engagement varies dependent on which party the politician
belongs to. Democratic and republican politicians are more divided in
their tweets content when the tweets express anger emotions, while they
are less divided when the tweets content express joy emotions.</p>
<h3 id="2-exploratory-data-analysis">2. Exploratory data analysis</h3>
<h4 id="21--research-question">2.1  Research question</h4>
<p>In the report, I will investigate how different emotions
(anger, joy, sadness, anticipation, trust, surprise and disgust) expressed in the tweet affect people’s
engagements with it.</p>
<h4 id="22-train-data">2.2 Train data</h4>
<p>The full data set contains tweets posted by the US senators and
representatives from 2008 to 2021 of different languages. In this
report, only tweets in English are investigated. From the three bar
plots, it can be observed that the number of posted tweets is increasing
by year. In year 2021, the number of posted tweets in each month is
pretty much the same around 40000, except in December due to that data
collection ends early in December 2021. The number of unique Twitter
users who have posted at least one tweet in each month is approximately
the same around 500. Therefore, from the perspective of tweets volume
and user participation, the data looks homogeneous across different
months in 2021. Due to the time and computation limits, I will use
tweets collected in Jan. 2021 for this report.</p>

<h4 id="23-preliminary-variable-selection">2.3 Preliminary variable selection</h4>
<p>Twitter API provides 90 features for each tweet. After checking the
missingness and meaning of each feature, features that have majority
missing values, like <code>quote_count</code>, are removed; Features that have
repeated meanings, like <code>reply_to_user_id</code> and <code>reply_to_screen_name</code>,
are removed; Features that have singular values, like <code>media_type</code>, are
removed; Features that are irrelevant to the research questions, like
<code>source</code>, are removed. Only 37 features are retained, and their names
are listed below.</p>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;favorite_count&quot;          &quot;retweet_count&quot;           &quot;followers_count&quot;        
##  [4] &quot;statuses_count&quot;          &quot;reply_to_status_id&quot;      &quot;is_quote&quot;               
##  [7] &quot;is_retweet&quot;              &quot;user_id&quot;                 &quot;screen_name&quot;            
## [10] &quot;friends_count&quot;           &quot;listed_count&quot;            &quot;favourites_count&quot;       
## [13] &quot;status_id&quot;               &quot;created_at&quot;              &quot;text&quot;                   
## [16] &quot;hashtags&quot;                &quot;urls_url&quot;                &quot;media_url&quot;

<h3 id="3-data-preprocessing">3. Data preprocessing</h3>
<p>In the step of data preprocessing, I will construct the binary response
variable, the user-specific predictors and the tweet-specific predictors
from the previously selected 37 features. After the feature engineering,
there are 19 variables in total for the model fitting.</p>
<h4 id="31-construct-the-binary-outcome-variable">3.1 Construct the binary outcome variable</h4>
<p>The question of interest is to predict the Twitter users’ engagement
with the posted tweet, so we need to first define engagement and explain
how to quantify it. According to the <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/using-the-tweet-activity-dashboard">Twitter help
center</a>,
engagement means the number of times users interacted with a tweet,
including retweets, replies, follows, likes, links, cards, hashtags,
embedded media, username, profile photo, or Tweet expansion. Here in the
report, I use a different and simplified definition for engagement.</p>
<p>I first define the <code>engagement rate</code>:</p>
<p>$$
engage\_rate = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{favoriate\_count + retweet\_count}{followers\_count}+\frac{favoriate\_count + retweet\_count}{statuses\_count})
$$
where <code>favoriate_count</code> and <code>retweet_count</code> are the number of favorites
and retweets received by the tweet, and <code>followers_count</code> and
<code>statuses_count</code> are the tweet user’s followers number and the total
number of tweets that the user has posted. In principle,
the rate takes into account the average interaction gives out by each
follower and the average interaction received by each tweet. Using this
equation, I then calculate the engagement rates for all tweets posted by
the politicians in the year 2021 and assign the 75% percentile as a threshold <code>engage_thresh</code>. Next I define the
binary variable <code>engage_active</code>, which has value 1 if the tweet’s
engagement rate is above the <code>engage_thresh</code>, otherwise it’s 0.
<code>engage_active=1</code> indicates that the tweet has active engagement.</p>
<p>$$
engage\_active = ifelse(engage\_rate &gt; engage\_thresh, 1, 0).
$$</p>
<h4 id="32-construct-the-user-specific-predictors">3.2 Construct the user-specific predictors</h4>
<p>The information about a tweet comes from two parts, (1) the general
information of the tweet such as users’ data, and (2) the text
information of the tweet such the emotions. In this step, I construct 10
variables with regard to the tweet’s general information.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>party (categorical)</code>: which party (Independent, Republican,
Democratic) the politician belongs to. I web-scraped the social
media accounts of the politicians from the <a href="https://triagecancer.org/congressional-social-media">public
website</a>, then
assign the party information to each user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>favor_perFriend (numerical)</code>: average number of favorites given by
the user to the friends (people followed by the user).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>listed_level (numerical)</code>: if the number of organizations the user
belongs to is less than the 0.25-th percentile of the number among
all users, the <code>listed_level = 1</code>. If the number is less than the
0.50-th percentile, the <code>listed_level = 2</code>. If the number is less
than the 0.75-th percentile, the <code>listed_level = 3</code>. If the number
is greater than the 0.75-th percentile, the <code>listed_level = 4</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>has_url (binary)</code>: whether or not url is included in the tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>has_media (binary)</code>: whether or not media (photo) is included in
the tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>is_independent (binary)</code>: if the tweet is not quoted or retweeted
or a reply, it’s an independent tweet, otherwise it’s not
independent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>engageQuoted_active (binary)</code>: the engage activity of the quoted
tweet. same definition as the <code>engage_active</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>engageRetweet_active (binary)</code>: the engage activity of the
retweeted tweet. same definition as the <code>engage_active</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>hashtag_num (numeric)</code>: the number of hashtag in the tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>metion_num (numeric)</code>: the number of mentioned names in the tweet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="33-construct-the-emotion-specific-predictors">3.3 Construct the emotion-specific predictors</h4>
<p>Each tweet text is first cleaned by removing the emojis, urls,
punctuations, extra white spaces and numbers. Then the cleaned text is
tokenized into words and from which common stop words (e.g. is, and) are
removed. Then I use the <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">NRC word-emotion association
lexicon</a> to
classify each word into different emotions. Last the number of words of
each emotion in a tweet is calculated and divided by the length of the
cleaned tweet text.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>textLength (numeric)</code>: length of the cleaned tweet text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>anticipation (numeric)</code>: average number of words belong to
anticipation in a tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>anger (numeric)</code>: average number of words belong to anger in a
tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fear (numeric)</code>: average number of words belong to fear in a tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>negative (numeric)</code>: average number of words belong to negative in
a tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>joy (numeric)</code>: average number of words belong to joy in a tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>positive (numeric)</code>: average number of words belong to positive in
a tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>trust (numeric)</code>: average number of words belong to trust in a
tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>sadness (numeric)</code>: average number of words belong to sadness in a
tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>surprise (numeric)</code>: average number of words belong to surprise in
a tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>disgust (numeric)</code>: average number of words belong to disgust in a
tweet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As we can observe from the summary statistics of each emotions, their
distribution are approximately in the same range.</p>

<h4 id="34-check-collinearity">3.4 Check collinearity</h4>
<p>Collinearity between variables can adversely affect the model
performance and gives inaccurate model inference. Therefore,
collinearity needs to be checked before we proceed to the model fitting.
So far, there are 22 variables constructed from the original tweet
features. Table2 shows that variables <code>anger</code>, <code>fear</code>, <code>sadness</code>,
<code>negative</code> have high correlations, and <code>joy</code>, <code>trust</code>, <code>positive</code> have
high correlations. Therefore, I will remove variables <code>negative</code>,
<code>positve</code> and <code>fear</code> from the features, which leaves us with 19
variables in total.</p>

<p>In the final data set for analysis, a total of 19 variables (including
the outcome variable) and 39396 observations are used. A set of logistic
regression models are fitted to investigate the contributions of
different emotions to the probability of tweets engagement.</p>

<h4 id="42-contributions-of-different-emotions">4.2 Contributions of different emotions</h4>
<p>The test statistics from ANOVA are applied to compare the relative
contributions of predictors to the probability of tweets engagement. The
figure below shows that the dependent information of retweeted and quoted tweets
make the most contribution the outcome probability. Among all the 7
emotions being investigated, the anger contributes more than other
emotions, and joy is the second largest. In the following analysis, I
will focus on the two emotions: anger and joy.</p>

<h4 id="43-logistic-spline-model">4.3 logistic spline model</h4>
<p>Though from last step it shows that anger and joy are statistically
significant, but they may have a non-linear relation with the
probability of tweets engagement. Here I fit a logistic spline model and
apply natural cubic spline with 5 knots on variables anger and joy
respectively. The ANOVA test shows that the non-linearity of anger and
joy has statistical significance.</p>
<p>Spline model formula.</p>
<pre><code>## engage_active ~ (engageQuoted_active + engageRetweet_active + 
##     listed_level + has_url + has_media + favor_perFriend + is_independent + 
##     hashtag_num + mention_num + tweetLength + anticipation + 
##     anger + joy + trust + sadness + surprise + disgust + party) - 
##     anger - joy + ns(anger, 5) + ns(joy, 5)
</code></pre>
<p>ANOVA test has P-value <code>1-pchisq(97.619, 4) = 0</code> less than 0.05, which
indicates the statistical significance of non-linearity of anger and
joy.</p>
<h4 id="44-logistic-spline-with-interaction-between-party-and-emotions">4.4 logistic spline with interaction between party and emotions</h4>
<p>It’s an interesting question to ask that if emotions anger and joy make
different contributions when taking into account the politicians’ party.
Here I fit a spline model with interaction terms between anger and
party, and joy and party. The ANOVA test shows that the interaction
terms have statistical significance.</p>
<p>Spline model with interaction formula.</p>
<pre><code>## engage_active ~ (engageQuoted_active + engageRetweet_active + 
##     listed_level + has_url + has_media + favor_perFriend + is_independent + 
##     hashtag_num + mention_num + tweetLength + anticipation + 
##     anger + joy + trust + sadness + surprise + disgust + party) - 
##     anger - joy + party * ns(anger, 5) + party * ns(joy, 5)
</code></pre>
<p>ANOVA test has P-value <code>1-pchisq(25.86, 13) = 0.018</code> less than 0.05,
which indicates the statistical significance of interaction between of
emotions and party.</p>
<h4 id="45-relation-between-emotions-and-the-outcome-probability">4.5 Relation between emotions and the outcome probability</h4>
<p>Since emotions have a non-linear relation with the engagement
probability, we can visualize the relation. It’s interesting to observe
from the plots that there seems exist an anger threshold, before the
threshold, the more angry the tweet, the more likely the tweet gets
active engagement. However, after the tweet’s anger reaches the
threshold, the more extreme emotion makes people less engaged with
democrat’s tweets, but keep engaged with republican’s tweets at the same
level. As for the emotion joy, the plot shows that the more joyful the
tweet, the less likely it gets active engagement. In addition, the plots
give the information that people are more likely to engage with angry
tweets than joyful tweets.</p>

<h4 id="51-top-10-anger-and-joy-words-used-in-the-tweets">5.1 Top 10 anger and joy words used in the tweets</h4>
<p>From section 4 we have made the conclusion that the emotion anger makes
people more likely to engage with the tweet than joy and other emotions.
Now the question of interest is what the tweets are talking about, and
what makes the tweet angry or joyful? I investigate the top 10 angry and
joyful words used by republican and democratic politicians in the tweets
in Jan. 2021. It shows that democratic tweets use more angry and joyful
words than the republican tweets. Recalling the news back at Jan. 2021,
the most anger-triggered event was the capitol attack. And the Word
frequency plot shows that politicians from both parties are angry about
the event, but their tones or narratives are a bit different. Democrats
used the angry words like “insurrection” and “mob”, while those words
didn’t not appear in republican’s tweets as much often. As for the
joyful events, the inauguration was what politicians mentioned most in
Jan. 2021.</p>

<h4 id="52-network-plots-of-politicians-based-on-angry-and-joyful-tweets">5.2 Network plots of politicians based on angry and joyful tweets</h4>
<p>We know that politicians from different parties usually have different
opinions. But are they also divisive facing the events that make both of them angry
or happy at the same time? In this section, I made network plots of the
politicians based on their correlations in terms of the angry words and
joyful words used in the tweets. As can be observed from the network
plots, the democrats and republicans are very divisive when it comes to
the tweets content that invokes angry feelings, as we can see that the
nodes of same color are more likely clustered together. Nevertheless,
the two parties are less divisive when tweeting contents that has joyful
attitudes, as the nodes of different colors tend to be clustered together, but
still the correlation between nodes of different colors are weaker than
the correlations between nodes of the same color.</p>

<h4 id="6-discussion-and-next-steps">6. Discussion and next steps</h4>
<p>In this report, I have investigated both quantitatively and
qualitatively, how the emotions, especially anger and joy, are affecting
people’s engagement with politicians' tweets from different parties. The major
conclusion is that angry tweets make people more likely to engage with
it than other emotions. However, should we encourage politicians to use more anger words in their tweets to get engagement? Personally, I think the answer depends on two things. Firstly, the conclusion needs to be further examined before adopt it in practice. Due to the fact that in Jan. 2021, the
whole nation was in shock of the capitol attack, it’s possible that
people could experience more extreme emotions than usual, which prompted
them to engagement more with the politicians’ tweets. Therefore, the conclusion needs to
be further verified on tweets collected at other time periods. Secondly, though it&rsquo;s encouraged to express negative feelings for the sake of mental health, in the context of politicians using the emotions as a tool to attract attention and engagement, we need to be very careful. Anger sometimes can trigger aggression and hostility, which should be alerted and constrained. Additionally, the report is focusing on interpreting the effects of certain
predictors on the outcome, it does not investigate the predictive
accuracy of the fitted models, which can be expanded in the future
if model’s predictive ability is of interest.</p>
