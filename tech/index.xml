      <description>In the statistics textbooks or papers, one would encounter many theorems and problems that are studying the limiting behavior of a series of random variables, for example, suppose \(X, X_1,&amp;hellip;,X_n,&amp;hellip;\) are random variables defined on a probability space, a question often asked is, what is the probability of the event that \(\lim_{n}X_n = X\)?</description>

      <description>As a statistician, I use R a lot in my school works and collaboration projects, since R provides almost all the statistical analysis tools I would need in my research, from data wrangling, statistical modeling, simulation, to data visualization.</description>

      <description>I recently read an interesting paper1 about how to sample from multivariate normal distribution with less computational complexity, and I really like the part where they make use of the block structure of the correlation matrix to conduct the eigen-decomposition.</description>
